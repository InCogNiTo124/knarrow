abstract = {Computer systems often reach a point at which the relative cost to increase some tunable parameter is no longer worth the corresponding performance benefit. These ``knees'' typically represent beneficial points that system designers have long selected to best balance inherent trade-offs. While prior work largely uses ad hoc, system-specific approaches to detect knees, we present Kneedle, a general approach to on line and off line knee detection that is applicable to a wide range of systems. We define a knee formally for continuous functions using the mathematical concept of curvature and compare our definition against alternatives. We then evaluate Kneedle's accuracy against existing algorithms on both synthetic and real data sets, and evaluate its performance in two different applications.},

 abstract = {This paper describes the concept of the "knee of a curve" as used to illuminate trade spaces for resource investment decisions. The knee is generally considered to be the point beyond which the curve flattens out, meaning the return on investment is diminishing. Although the concept of the knee seems quite intuitive, it can be ambiguous when applied to generic cost-performance functions. This paper presents two distinct mathematical interpretations of the knee using Calculus and Analytic Geometry: first, the point of maximum curvature; and second, a derivation using the area between the curve and the curve's upper bound. This paper concludes that the knee can provide useful clues in the Analysis of Alternatives, but is by no means conclusive.},

We obtain a practical, effective method for estimating the optimum amount of smoothing from the data. Derivatives can be estimated from the data by differentiating the resulting (nearly) optimally smoothed spline.},
